# 🎨 Understanding Pattern Problems

## 💡 What is a Pattern Problem?
Loop is the main concept of Coding.
A **pattern problem** is a coding exercise where you print specific **shapes, numbers, or designs** (like triangles, pyramids, diamonds, etc.) using **loops**.

You’re not doing it for the output’s beauty — you’re doing it to **train your brain to think logically** and understand **how loops, conditions, and variables work together**.

## 🧠 Why You Need It
Before diving into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), you must first be comfortable with:
- Breaking a problem into smaller logical steps  
- Using nested loops effectively  
- Managing indexes, spaces, and print conditions  
- Visualizing how code executes line by line  

Practicing pattern problems builds these core skills — the same logic later helps with arrays, matrices, recursion, and other DSA concepts.

## Rules to Follow while Pattern design.
- All patterns will have nested loops- Outer loops and inner loops
- Outer loops are rows and Iner loops are columns.
- For the Outer loop count the number of rows/lines.
- For the Inner loop foucus on the columns and try to connect to the outerloops which is rows.
- Print them inside the inner loop
- Obeserve Symmentry (Optional)
