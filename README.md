# Data-Structure
- A Data Structure is the way of orginizing data so that it can be used effectively.
- Essential ingredients to creating fast and poerful algorithms.
- makes code cleaner and easier to understand
- good code results in great product

## Abstract Data Type
- ADT is conceptual model that defines and classify data structure based on how they are used and what they provide.
- They dont specify about how the data structure is implemented or in what programming language they follow.

### Example of ADT
Here is a list of common Abstract Data Types (ADT) and the various concrete data structures that can be used to implement them.
Abstract Data Type (ADT)	Conceptual Description (What it does)	Common Implementations (How it's built)
List	A sequential collection of elements accessible by index.	Array (or Dynamic Array/ArrayList), Linked List (Singly or Doubly Linked)
Stack	A Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) collection, like a stack of plates.	Array, Linked List
Queue	A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) collection, like people in a line.	Array, Linked List
Set	An unordered collection of unique elements.	Hash Table (or HashSet), Binary Search Tree (BST), Sorted Array
Map (Dictionary)	Stores key-value pairs, allowing retrieval by unique key.	Hash Table (or HashMap), Binary Search Tree (or TreeMap), Balanced Tree (e.g., Red-Black Tree)
Priority Queue	A collection where elements are removed based on priority, not insertion order.	Heap (often implemented using an Array), Binary Search Tree
Graph	A collection of nodes (vertices) and connections (edges).	Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List (using an Array of Linked Lists or Hash Maps)
Tree	A hierarchical structure of nodes.	Linked Nodes (using pointers/references), Array (especially for complete trees like Heaps)
