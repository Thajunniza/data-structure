# Two Pointers
The two pointers pattern is a versatile technique used in problem-solving to efficiently traverse or manipulate sequential data structures, such as arrays or linked lists.
It maintains two pointers
iterate in one or both dirextions

## Types Of Two Pointers
1. 
2. Parallel Pointers
3. Trigger Based Pointers

## When to use
- Linear data structure: The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.

Process pairs: Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.

- Dynamic pointer movement: Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures.
- sorted array or linked list
- find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition
